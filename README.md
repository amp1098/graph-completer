# graph-completer
This program will generate a complete graph for any set of points. 
The goal is to eventually determine the number of intersections formed and, more generally, the number of regions formed by each set of intersections.
In order to tell if 3 points (i.e., the minimum number of points that can form a polygon) are forming a region, we could probably use the orientation of those points to somehow figure that out.
The program can draw the lines that are needed, but it cannot yet find intersections nor regions.
